<h3><a name="HOW_TO_BE_A_GOOD_RADIO_ACTOR" id="HOW_TO_BE_A_GOOD_RADIO_ACTOR"></a><i>HOW TO BE A GOOD RADIO ACTOR</i></h3>

<p>The play in this book has actually been produced on the radio. Possibly
you have listened to this one when you tuned in at home. The
persons whose voices you heard as you listened, looked just as they did
when they left their homes to go to the studio, although they were
taking the parts of men and women who lived long ago and who wore
costumes very different from the ones we wear today.</p>

<p>The persons whose voices you heard stood close together around the
microphone, each one reading from a copy of the play in his hand.
Since they could not be seen, they did not act parts as in other plays,
but tried to make their voices show how they felt.</p>

<p>When you give these plays you will not need costumes and you will
not need scenery, although you can easily arrange a broadcasting studio
if you wish. You will not need to memorize your parts; in fact, it
will not be like a real radio broadcast if you do so, and, furthermore,
you will not want to, since you will each have a copy of the book in
your hands. All you will need to do is to remember that you are taking
the part of a radio actor, that you are to read your speeches very distinctly,
and that by your voice you will make your audience understand
how you feel. In this way you will have the fun of living
through some of the great moments of history.</p>


<h3><i>HOW TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS IN THE PLAY</i></h3>

<p>There are some directions in this play which may be new to you, but
these are necessary, for you are now in a radio broadcasting studio,
talking in front of a microphone. The word [<i>in</i>] means that the
character is standing close to the microphone, while [<i>off</i>] indicates that
he is farther away, so that his voice sounds faint. When the directions
[<i>off, coming in</i>] are given, the person speaking is away from the microphone
at first but gradually comes closer. The words [<i>mob</i>] or [<i>crowd
noise</i>] you will understand mean the sound of many people talking in
the distance.</p>

<p>Both the English and the dialect used help make the characters live,
so the speeches have been written in the way in which these men and
women would talk. This means that sometimes the character may use
what seems to you unusual English. The punctuation helps, too, to
make the speeches sound like real conversation; for example, you will
find that a dash is often used to show that a character is talking very
excitedly.</p>

<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>On July 1, 1776, the Continental Congress of the American
Colonies faced one of the most important crises this
country has ever passed through. Upon what happened
that night depended the fate of the resolution before Congress
which declared that: "These United Colonies are,
and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that
they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown,
and that all political connection between them and the
State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved."
This was known as the Lee Resolution, the fate of which
was to be decided by one of the most famous rides in history&mdash;Caesar
Rodney's ride.</p>

<p>Let us begin our story on the morning of July 1, 1776, in
the Continental Congress at Philadelphia. For nearly
three hours the Lee Resolution has been the subject of furious
debate. The members are all excited, anxious, overwrought.
The debate has become bitter, for some of the
members are unalterably opposed to independence. It is
about noon when Dr. Franklin rises to address the Chair:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Mr. President&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>I have sat uneasily, sir, during the furious debate, hoping
that the storm would subside, and the bright sun of reason
would shine upon us through the parting clouds. But, sir,
I am fearful that the storm is gathering with new fury,
and that we may be blown too far from our course to steer
safely into harbor. Perhaps, sir, we should end this debate
which seems to bid fair to wreck our unity. I move you,
sir, that we lay the Lee Resolution on the table.</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>
No, no, bring it to a vote!<br />
Yes, lay it on the table!<br />
Let's vote on it now!<br />
Have it over with! [<i>etc.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK [<i>sound of gavel</i>]</p>

<p>Order! Order! Do I hear a second to Dr. Franklin's motion?</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>You have heard the motion&mdash;are there any remarks?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Mr. President&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>I believe, sir, with Dr. Franklin, that the debate has lasted
too long; but, sir, I am hopeful that with only a little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
delay we may secure unanimous action on the most important
question which has ever been before this body.
With Dr. Franklin's permission, I suggest an amendment,
sir, that the resolution be laid upon the table until tomorrow
morning. [<i>murmurs and comments</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Does Dr. Franklin accept the amendment?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Mr. President, I have only one desire in this matter, and
that is to see this body united and of one mind. If in the
peace of a quiet July afternoon and the tranquillity of a
night's rest we can find that bond which will unite us and
hold us together, I say, yes&mdash;I accept Mr. Rutledge's
amendment. Let us vote upon the Lee Resolution tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>But the first thing tomorrow morning!</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;the first thing tomorrow morning. [<i>murmurs of
assent</i>]</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK [<i>sound of gavel</i>]</p>

<p>You have heard the motion. Are there any further remarks?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Question! Question! Question!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Those favoring?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;aye&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Contrary minded?&mdash;Carried! [<i>sound of gavel</i>]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>And now, sir, I move we adjourn until nine o'clock tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">VOICE</p>

<p>Second!</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Before putting Mr. Rutledge's motion to adjourn, I wish
to caution all the members to the greatest secrecy. Whatever
the outcome of our deliberation, we can only cause
harm to ourselves and to our country by divulging what
has been done here. The motion to adjourn is before the
Congress. Those favoring?</p>

<p class="center">ALL</p>

<p>Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;aye&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HANCOCK</p>

<p>Contrary minded?&mdash;Carried! [<i>sound of gavel</i>] Congress
is adjourned until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">ALL [<i>confusion and noise</i>]</p>

<p>
It can't be done!<br />
It's useless!<br />
We can never get them to vote with us!<br />
We must be united!<br />
We can never unite on independence!<br />
We must bring this thing about!<br />
Will you join me?<br />
We have no power to vote. [<i>etc.</i>]<br />
</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Rutledge&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, Dr. Franklin?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Please&mdash;may I speak to you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE [<i>coming in</i>]</p>

<p>Of course, Doctor&mdash;what is it?</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Sit down here, my boy.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Do you think you can swing the South Carolina delegation
for independence?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>I don't know, Dr. Franklin, but I've invited them to my
lodging to dine with me and talk over the question.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Good, good! Often an excellent meal and a taste of fine
wine carry more conviction than hours of argument. As
I see it now, we must swing South Carolina, Pennsylvania,
and Delaware into line before tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Count on me for South Carolina.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>And I'll take care of Pennsylvania. I think I'll try your
strategy&mdash;I'll invite the delegation to dinner.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Then that leaves Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>I wonder if McKeen of Delaware, who favors independence&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Yes, I know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN [<i>going on</i>]</p>

<p>&mdash;can't swing Dr. Reed in the same way.</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Perhaps.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Oh, there's McKeen now. Call him over here&mdash;will you,
Rutledge?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Of course. [<i>calling</i>] Oh, Mr. McKeen! Mr. McKeen!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN [<i>off</i>]</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center">RUTLEDGE</p>

<p>Come over here a moment&mdash;will you, please?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Why, certainly. [<i>coming in</i>] Well, Dr. Franklin, we
had a stormy session this morning.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>All that will be forgotten&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>In victory.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>If only we can make our victory complete.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>What chance is there for Delaware to join us?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>None, I'm afraid. Dr. Reed and I are the only delegates
here&mdash;and he is as unalterably opposed to independence
as I am in favor of it. The vote of Delaware won't count.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>What about getting another favoring delegate here by tomorrow?
Could you do that?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Well, Doctor, I'm afraid it's out of the question. Caesar
Rodney favors the resolution, I know, but he's at home in
Dover, Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Send a postrider for him!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's eighty miles.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Well, that's not impossible. We have until nine o'clock
tomorrow morning&mdash;it's now&mdash;let's see&mdash;just a little
after twelve&mdash;that's nearly twenty-one hours.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But Rodney was very ill when he went home last week.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Perhaps he's better by now. Write him a letter&mdash;send it
by the postrider&mdash;urge upon him the enormous importance
of his getting here by tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Well, I can try it.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Do, Mr. McKeen, for we must have unanimous action on
this question! We must hang together on this, or we'll all
hang separately!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>All right, sir, I'll go to the postrider's at once! Good day.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>Good day. And let us pray that Rodney gets here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>So McKeen hurried to the postrider's stable. Now the
postrider was to the people of Revolutionary days what
the telegraph or the telephone is to us today. He carried
messages at a very rapid rate, for those days, by changing
horses every ten or fifteen miles.</p>

<p>As McKeen came up to the post stable, he saw the stableman
sitting on a bench, hard at work cleaning a saddle.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Good day, sir.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Day to ye.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I want a postrider.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Wal', postriders are all out, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Oh, too bad! When do you expect one back?</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Dunno fer certain. Mebbe three or four hours&mdash;mebbe
longer.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But look here&mdash;I can't wait that long&mdash;I want one right
away!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>I'm right sorry, sir, but thar ain't nawthin' I kin do about
et. Come back this evenin' and I kin hev a man fer ye,
but not before.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>But, look here, my man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>My name's Uriah Clarke&mdash;at yer service.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>All right, Mr. Clarke, I've got to have a postrider to carry
a very important message to Dover, Delaware, to get a
man back here from Dover by nine o'clock tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Dover, Delaware, and back?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Yes, by nine tomorrow morning!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Why, sir, it's nigh onto eighty mile to Delaware.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I know it.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Eighty mile thar and eighty mile back&mdash;why, pshaw,
sir, we couldn't do thet under a whole day&mdash;even ef we
hed a rider to send out right now&mdash;which we ain't.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Twenty-five pounds if you'll do it!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>But how kin we? Ain't I jest told ye we ain't got no
riders?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Why can't you go?</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Law, sir, I ain't rode a trip like thet fer years. It 'ud more
than likely kill me.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Fifty pounds if you'll do it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>No, sir!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Name your own sum.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Ye couldn't pay me, sir&mdash;not fer thet ride. I know thet
road like a book&mdash;bad, slow, hard on hoss flesh when ye
take it easy. I'd stave up half my hosses&mdash;not to mention
myself, sir, and I hev a mind fer myself, too.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Change riders&mdash;change your horses oftener&mdash;but make
it you must!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Not ef 'twas a matter of life and death, sir.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's more than that!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Eh? What? What ye talkin' about?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It's a matter of life and death for a nation&mdash;our country!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Is et somethin' to do with Congress, sir?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Wal', sir, I'm a Son of Liberty, and et's my sworn duty to
go whar I'm wanted fer liberty, and ef thet's et&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>It is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Then I'll go.</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>I'll pay your price.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Thar won't be no price! I'll git yer man to Philadelphia
tomorrow mornin' ef I hev to carry him myself. Who's
yer man?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Caesar Rodney of Dover, Delaware. Here's a letter for
him.</p>

<p class="center">URIAH</p>

<p>Caesar Rodney&mdash;I'll fetch him!</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p class="center">URIAH [<i>going</i>]</p>

<p>Hey, Jim! Throw a saddle on thet bay mare! [<i>orders
fade out</i>]</p>


<h3>ANNOUNCER</h3>

<p>For our next scene let us look in at the home of Caesar
Rodney in Dover, Delaware. It is nearly eight o'clock on
the evening of July 1, 1776. Rodney, pale and drawn,
with the languid air of a man but recently out of a sick
bed, is sitting in an easy chair. Mrs. Rodney is hovering
over him with a protecting anxiety&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You're sure you feel strong enough to sit up, Caesar?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Prudence, I'm all right, I tell you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You're sure you're not in any pain?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>No, no, dear, I'm all right&mdash;just weak, that's all.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>Now, Caesar, you just mustn't overtax your strength&mdash;remember
this is only the second day you've been out of
bed.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Yes, dear.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>And the physician said you mustn't overdo.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>All right, dear. I wonder what's happening in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>You must get your mind off Congress. You mustn't
worry.</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>I know, but&mdash;what date's today?</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>July first&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>July first. Why, today the Lee Resolution was to come
up for final action! Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't there!</p>

<p class="center">PRUDENCE</p>

<p>What's the Lee Resolution?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>It's the most important motion that's come before the
Continental Congress in the two years Congress has been

<p>You mean to say they're even considering such a thing?</p>

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>Of course. It's the only thing left for us. We've got to

<p class="center">RODNEY</p>

<p>It might be something exciting&mdash;something you oughtn't

July 2, 1776. The hour for assembling Congress is drawing
near. Thomas McKeen of Delaware is standing on the
steps anxiously waiting and watching for Caesar Rodney.
Dr. Franklin rides up in his carriage and steps out.</p>

<p>Good morning, Dr. Franklin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Good morning, good morning, my boy. Has Rodney
come?</p>

<p class="center">MCKEEN</p>

<p>Not yet. I've been waiting for an hour.</p>

<p class="center">FRANKLIN</p>

<p>And so Rodney, with his mud-spattered clothes, booted
and spurred as he had ridden, went into the meeting of
Congress and secured the adherence of Delaware to the Lee
Resolution. When Congress was called to order and the
vote taken, every Colony voted for independence, and, as
New York did not vote at all, there was not a dissenting
voice in the victory!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
